  This i  I am Co-founder and VP Advanced Technology at [AppNeta](http://appneta.com).
  I also am the maintainer of [Tcpreplay](http://tcpreplay.appneta.com),
  an open-source project for replaying previously recorded network
  traffic. More importantly, I am a father of 2 wonderful girls, and husband to Barbara for
  the last 32 years.

  My hobbies include fermentation, and attempt to make better wine, beer and bread than you
  can usually buy. I also enjoy cycling, regularly commuting a marathon distance daily.

  This site is under construction. More to come.
